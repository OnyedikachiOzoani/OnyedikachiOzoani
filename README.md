I'm **Onyedikachi**. A Full stack web aspirant.  

I have a good foundation on **HTML**/**CSS** and **JavaScript**. I recently finished the [Frontend Mentor Roadmap](https://discord.com/channels/824970620529279006/1131865518618460210/1131872426364506282) for **Responsive Web Development** to **VanillaJS solid foundation**. I'm currently on a certification course: [**JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures**](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/) from *FreeCodeCamp*. This course also covers **Object Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Functional Programming**, algorithmic thinking, how to work with local storage, and how to **fetch data using an API**.  

After that course, I'm heading for **ReactJS**, **NodeJS**, **TypeScript**, **ExpressJS**, and other **MERN** technologies.  

You can reach me through my email address: [ozohenrywk@gmail.com](mailto:ozohenrywk@gmail.com), and on Telegram through: [**@OnyedikachiOzoani**](https://t.me/onyedikachiozoani).

I also have interest for **VueJS** and **Svelte**.
